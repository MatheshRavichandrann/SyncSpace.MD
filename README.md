# **SyncSpace.MD (WebSocket Chat Application)**

Just learned WebSocket, so I decided to make a project using it! Here's a **Chat Application** built with **Spring Boot** and **WebSocket**.

If you wanna try it out or use it for your own learning, just clone the repo, open it in your IDE (I use IntelliJ), and make sure you have the necessary plugins.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Open it in your IDE (IntelliJ is what I use).
3. Make sure you have the necessary Spring Boot plugins installed.
4. Run the application (you probably know how to do this since you’re here!).
5. Open `localhost:8080` in your browser to access the chat app.
6. **Open a new tab** in your browser and visit `localhost:8080` again to simulate multiple users chatting.

### Notes:
I think I don’t need to explain the whole process of running a Spring Boot app, you already know that. I’ll leave the rest to you! ;)

If you run into any errors or problems, just let me know and I’ll try to fix them for you.

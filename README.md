# **WebSocket Chat Application** ðŸ’¬ðŸš€

Just learned WebSocket, so I decided to make a project using it! Here's a **Chat Application** built with **Spring Boot** and **WebSocket**.

If you wanna try it out or use it for your own learning, just clone the repo, open it in your IDE (I use IntelliJ), and make sure you have the necessary plugins.

### Steps:
1. Clone the repo to your local machine.
2. Open it in your IDE (IntelliJ is what I use).
3. Make sure you have the necessary Spring Boot plugins installed.
4. Run the application (you probably know how to do this since youâ€™re here!).

### Notes:
I think I donâ€™t need to explain the whole process of running a Spring Boot app, you already know that. Iâ€™ll leave the rest to you! ðŸ˜Ž

If you run into any errors or problems, just let me know and Iâ€™ll try to fix them for you.
